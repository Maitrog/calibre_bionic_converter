# Calibre Bionic Converter

This script scans your Calibre library for eBooks, allows you to select which books to convert, and applies Bionic Reading typography to the selected books. The Bionic Reading conversion is handled by a script from the repository [arcanite24/libre-bioread](https://github.com/arcanite24/libre-bioread). Ensure that the `apply_bioread.py` script is downloaded and placed in the same directory as this script.
